    "# Model Output Walkthrough: History-Centric Next-Location Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a complete, step-by-step walkthrough of how the History-Centric Next-Location Prediction model processes input data and generates predictions. The notebook is **self-contained** and does not depend on any external project scripts - all necessary code is included directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: How trajectory sequences are loaded and prepared\n",
    "2. **Model Architecture**: The structure and components of the History-Centric model\n",
    "3. **Input Processing**: How raw trajectory data is transformed into model inputs\n",
    "4. **Forward Pass**: Step-by-step execution through the model layers\n",
    "5. **History Scoring**: How the model leverages visit history for predictions\n",
    "6. **Output Generation**: How final location predictions are computed\n",
    "7. **Evaluation**: How we measure model performance using various metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is based on a critical observation: **83.81% of next locations are already in the visit history**. Therefore, the model combines history-based scoring with learned patterns to make accurate predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **HistoryCentricModel** combines two strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. History-Based Scoring\n",
    "- **Recency**: More recent visits are weighted higher (exponential decay)\n",
    "- **Frequency**: Locations visited more often get higher scores\n",
    "- **Scale Factor**: Amplifies history scores to dominate predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Learned Transformer Component\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Encode locations, users, and temporal features\n",
    "- **Self-Attention**: Captures sequential patterns in visit history\n",
    "- **Feedforward Network**: Learns complex relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Strategy\n",
    "The final prediction combines:\n",
    "- History scores (weighted heavily - ~11x)\n",
    "- Learned model scores (weighted lightly - ~0.22x)\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🔍 Complete Process Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: Trajectory sequence with location IDs, user info, and temporal features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **History Scoring** (Primary Component ~83% weight):\n",
    "   - Compute recency scores: Recent visits get higher weights\n",
    "   - Compute frequency scores: Often-visited places get higher weights\n",
    "   - Combine and scale: `history_score = scale × (recency + freq_weight × frequency)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learned Model** (Secondary Component ~17% weight):\n",
    "   - Embed locations and users into dense vectors\n",
    "   - Encode temporal features using circular representations\n",
    "   - Apply self-attention to capture sequential patterns\n",
    "   - Generate learned scores for all locations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensemble**:\n",
    "   - Normalize learned scores to comparable scale\n",
    "   - Combine: `final = history_scores + model_weight × learned_scores`\n",
    "   - History dominates (~11x vs ~0.22x for learned)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction**:\n",
    "   - Select location with highest final score\n",
    "   - Report top-K for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Performance Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieves strong performance through its hybrid approach:\n",
    "- Leverages the statistical insight that most next locations are revisits\n",
    "- Uses learned patterns for novel locations and temporal dependencies\n",
    "- Remains compact (under 500K parameters) while being highly effective\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Design Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's architecture reflects a key insight from data analysis: **most next locations are revisits**. By heavily weighting history-based scoring while still learning sequential patterns, the model achieves high accuracy with a compact parameter budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learned component handles:\n",
    "- Novel locations (not in history)\n",
    "- Temporal patterns (time-of-day, day-of-week effects)\n",
    "- User-specific preferences\n",
    "- Transition patterns between locations\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach outperforms purely learned models while remaining interpretable and parameter-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
